# Automated the analysis of patient experience from feedback collected from NHS patients across different platforms using natural language processing, data science and data analysis techniques.
Analyzing patient experience involves identifying patient feedback, which healthcare organizations use to evaluate their services. Manually analyzing such data would be extremely
difficult, time-consuming, and expensive hence the need to automate this process. This research looks at collecting feedback in the form of online reviews from the National Health
Service, in England, across its website and google, from hospitals and General Practices. The
feedback was then analyzed using data analysis techniques and topic modeling to identify
key themes, trends, and anomalies. These experiments provided valuable insights towards
finding the different topics mentioned by patients from which we could infer which specific
service struggled or performed well and how: firstly, the services compared to each other
and secondly, how the platforms compared against each other. We were also able to identify
where the potential problem areas in England corresponding to the negative words associated with certain topics were found and the respective areas corresponding to positive patient
experience, using a choropleth representation.
